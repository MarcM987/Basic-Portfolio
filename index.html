                    I am Marc Martinez. I am currently an undergraduate student, studying Software Engineering. I have a passion for programming, tech, and learning in general. Having experienced first hand Java, C++, C, and assembly language (also Matlab/Octave and a bit of scripting), I am no stranger to programming, but I am always looking for more and I by no means an expert in those languages. Some interesting related experienc would be that I am also currently practicing machine learning, with hopes to move onto deep learning. I have a certain familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript but I'll just they weren't my strongest suits.<br><br>
                    Outside of the scholastic world I also enjoy various hobbies. I am a licensed Skydiver and Scubadiver. I've also recently been attending flight school and with 36 hours of flight under my belt, I hope to that list. I enjoy hiking, camping, and traveling at any opportunity. Essentially, if its active, mentally stimulating, or adventurous, I'm a fan. Unless it's running, not sure I'll ever get used to that one.<br><br>
